- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gogie607
- 👀 I've been developing software for well over 20 years mainly focused
-   on c and c++ embedded systems. I also code alot using python
- 🌱 I've been recently dabbling in Android Studio Kotlin and the new
- Compose GUI interface for Android based apps. I have created, to cute little
- test programs for my personal use and found it quite rewarding.
-    I am currently learning pytorch and the basics of AI generative models 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...??? Have not yet decided
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: ...Us and Them ??? What am I suppose to write here?
- ⚡ Fun fact: A bear went into the woods to do.... Feed this into chatgpt2.
- It does not know the answer.  Chatgpt3 does know but refuses to say it?

  Aside from the above template nonsense, I love coding and also play piano to
relax and gather my thoughts.  I also am I hobby Imker and take care of a few beehives
in the local Garden workshop. I also make a mean chocolate chip cookie
